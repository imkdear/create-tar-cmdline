    Verify tar.gz file using the ls command and tar command

Let us see all commands and options in details.
Linux create tar.gz file with tar command

Say you want to create tar.gz file named projects.tar.gz for directory called $HOME/projects/:
$ ls -l $HOME/projects/

Sample outputs:

total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 vivek vivek 4096 Oct 30 22:30 helloworld
drwxr-xr-x 4 vivek vivek 4096 Oct 30 13:16 myhellowebapp

The syntax for the tar command is as follows:
tar -czvf filename.tar.gz /path/to/dir1
tar -czvf filename.tar.gz /path/to/dir1 dir2 file1 file2
# Create a tar.gz file from all pdf (".pdf") files
tar -czvf archive.tgz *.pdf

To create projects.tar.gz in the current working directory, run:
$ tar -czvf projects.tar.gz $HOME/projects/
